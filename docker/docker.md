#### How docker works


Docker is a tool to virtualize images created from code.

Basically, we write code, like a backend API, then we create an image, that is
all the files that compose our API, the environment settings, 
the source code, the dependencies, libraries.

With that image we can tell docker to create a container from that image 
using the Dockerfile, where me set a layered commands to tell docker how
to run the API.
